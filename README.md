There are two different algorithm i.e. BFS and DFS.
Below are the steps to run the code

Requirements-
Python3 (Download the Python3 from this link - https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install it)
Git (Download the Git from this link - https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it)

Initial steps-
1) Open Terminal and move to the desired path where you want clone the repository.
2) Clone the repository by using below command on terminal-
	git clone <repository-link>
3) Move to the clone folder by using command on terminal-
	cd <repository-name>

Run the code-
1) For Running BFS code, execute below command on terminal-
	python3 BFS.py
2) For Running DFS code, execute below command on terminal-
	python3 DFS.py
